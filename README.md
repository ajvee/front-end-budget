Hello anyone who is seeing this, 

My <b>Backend</b> will be running on this server http://localhost:3333/transactions and my <b>Frontend</b> will be running on http://localhost:3000/.

<b>Backend</b> GitHub Link https://github.com/ajvee/budget-app-backend

Here is a link to my trello board https://trello.com/b/pbqFoQjV/fullstack-budget-app

All the added and deleted transactions from my frontend will update my backend.
